# PRD: Pharmaceutical Campaign Automation

## Executive Summary

An AI-powered pharmaceutical campaign automation platform that transforms manual 4-6 week campaign creation into automated workflows completing in just few minutes. The system uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) with LangGraph workflow management to orchestrate 7 specialized agents that automate the complete pharmaceutical campaign lifecycle from strategy to activation.

**Value Proposition**: 80% reduction in manual coordination work, 3x increase in campaign volume capacity, while maintaining 100% pharmaceutical compliance standards.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points
Pharmaceutical brand managers face significant operational inefficiencies:
- **Time-intensive process**: Campaign creation requires 4-6 weeks of manual coordination across 6 enterprise systems
- **Administrative overhead**: 70% of time spent on administrative tasks rather than strategic planning  
- **Manual system handoffs**: Between Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Veeva Vault, and Adobe GenStudio
- **No automation exists**: For compliance-heavy pharmaceutical marketing workflows
- **Context loss and errors**: Occur during system-to-system transfers
- **Resource constraints**: Limited capacity to scale campaign volume

### Why This Matters Now
- Pharmaceutical industry requires faster time-to-market for therapeutic awareness campaigns
- Regulatory compliance demands consistent, auditable workflows
- Digital transformation initiatives require automation of manual processes
- Competition requires more agile campaign creation capabilities

3. **Agent 3**: Content Organization - Metadata and compliance tagging (≤30s)
4. **Agent 4**: Veeva Integration - MLR approval workflow upload (≤45s)
5. **Agent 5**: Audience Targeting - HCP audience segmentation (≤60s)
6. **Agent 6**: Campaign Activation - Salesforce campaign launch (≤45s)

**Data Validation**
- Accept only pharmaceutical/medical campaign requests
- Reject generic marketing requests ("Make money fast", "Social media marketing")
- Require pharmaceutical keywords: campaign, treatment, doctor, physician, specialist, medical, therapy
