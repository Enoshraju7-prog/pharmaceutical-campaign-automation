- **Service Coordination**: FastAPI and Streamlit concurrent execution management
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling and resource cleanup procedures
- **Logging Configuration**: Structured logging for both services with pharmaceutical audit trail
- **Error Recovery**: Service restart and failure handling mechanisms
- **Development vs Production**: Configuration switching and environment detection
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU usage optimization documentation

### Docker Containerization Preparation
- **Dockerfile Creation**: Multi-stage build for production optimization
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Services orchestration with database and networking
- **Environment Variables**: Container-specific configuration management
- **Volume Management**: Database persistence and log file handling
- **Health Checks**: Container health validation and restart policies
- **Security Considerations**: Non-root user execution and pharmaceutical data protection
- **Production Scaling**: Load balancing and horizontal scaling preparation
