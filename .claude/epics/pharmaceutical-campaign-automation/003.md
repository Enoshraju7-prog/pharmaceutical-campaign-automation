# Agent Framework

## Description

Implement the core agent orchestration framework including the Master Orchestrator (Agent 7), LangGraph workflow state management, Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol, and agent timing validation. This framework serves as the backbone for coordinating all specialized agents in the pharmaceutical campaign automation system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Master Orchestrator (Agent 7) fully implemented and operational
- [ ] LangGraph workflow state management handles complex multi-agent scenarios
- [ ] A2A communication protocol enables reliable inter-agent messaging
- [ ] Agent timing validation framework prevents conflicts and ensures proper sequencing
- [ ] Framework supports dynamic agent registration and discovery
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms for agent failures

## Technical Details

### Master Orchestrator (Agent 7)
- Central coordination hub for all specialized agents
- Campaign workflow orchestration and task delegation
- Real-time monitoring of agent status and performance
- Dynamic load balancing and resource allocation
- Conflict resolution and priority management
- Audit trail for all orchestration decisions

### LangGraph Workflow State Management
- State machine definition for campaign lifecycle stages
- Transition rules and validation logic
- Persistent state storage with rollback capabilities
- Parallel execution tracking for concurrent agents
- Conditional branching based on campaign requirements
- State synchronization across distributed agent instances

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Protocol
- Standardized message format for inter-agent communication
- Asynchronous messaging with delivery guarantees
- Request-response patterns for synchronous operations
- Event publishing and subscription mechanisms
- Message queuing and priority handling
- Authentication and authorization for agent communications

### Agent Timing Validation Framework
- Temporal constraint definition and enforcement
- Dependency resolution and execution ordering
- Deadlock detection and prevention
- Resource contention management
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- SLA compliance tracking and alerting

### Agent Registration and Discovery
- Dynamic agent registration with capability advertisement
- Service discovery mechanism for agent location
- Health check and heartbeat monitoring
- Graceful agent deregistration and failover
- Load balancing based on agent capabilities and availability

## Dependencies

- **[001] Foundation Setup**: Requires database models (AgentExecution) and API infrastructure for agent communication and state persistence

## Effort Estimate

**Large (5-7 days)**
- Master Orchestrator implementation: 2 days
- LangGraph workflow integration: 2 days
- A2A communication protocol: 1.5 days
- Timing validation framework: 1 day
- Integration testing and debugging: 0.5 day

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Master Orchestrator can successfully coordinate multiple mock agents
- [ ] LangGraph workflows execute complex multi-step scenarios without errors
- [ ] A2A communication handles all message types with proper error handling
- [ ] Timing validation prevents conflicts in concurrent agent execution
- [ ] Agent registration/discovery works across system restarts
- [ ] Framework performance meets latency requirements (< 100ms for message routing)
- [ ] Comprehensive error recovery demonstrated through fault injection testing
- [ ] Integration tests cover all major workflow scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes architecture diagrams and API specifications
