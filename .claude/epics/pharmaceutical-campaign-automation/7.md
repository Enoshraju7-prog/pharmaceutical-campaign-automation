## Overview
Implement comprehensive validation system for natural language input processing, pharmaceutical compliance, and content validation with intelligent parsing and rejection logic.

## Validation Components

### Natural Language Input Parsing
- Intent recognition for campaign objectives
- Entity extraction for key pharmaceutical terms
- Sentiment analysis for brand positioning
- Context understanding for regulatory constraints
- Ambiguity detection and clarification requests
- Multi-language support for global campaigns

### Pharmaceutical Keyword Validation
- Therapeutic area terminology validation
- Drug name and indication cross-referencing
- Medical terminology accuracy checking
- Regulatory keyword compliance (FDA, EMA guidelines)
- Contraindication and safety information validation
- Clinical trial data reference verification

### Therapeutic Area/Specialty/Region Extraction
- **Therapeutic Areas**: Oncology, Cardiology, Neurology, Immunology, etc.
- **Specialties**: HCP specialty mapping (Cardiologists, Oncologists, PCPs)
- **Regions**: Geographic targeting with regulatory zone awareness
- Cross-reference validation between areas, specialties, and approved indications
- Market access and reimbursement considerations by region

### Input Acceptance/Rejection Logic
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Complete therapeutic area specification
  - Valid target audience definition
  - Compliant messaging objectives
  - Approved indication alignment
  - Budget and timeline feasibility

- **Rejection Criteria**:
  - Off-label promotion attempts
  - Non-compliant messaging
  - Incomplete regulatory information
  - Conflicting therapeutic areas
  - Invalid target demographics

### Compliance Validation for Content
- MLR (Medical, Legal, Regulatory) compliance checking
- Fair balance requirement validation
- Risk/benefit information verification
- Adverse event reporting compliance
- PDMA and PhRMA code adherence
- Country-specific regulatory compliance (21 CFR Part 202, etc.)

### Validation Workflow
1. **Input Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize user input
2. **Entity Recognition**: Extract pharmaceutical entities and relationships
3. **Compliance Screening**: Check against regulatory databases
4. **Cross-validation**: Verify consistency across all input elements
5. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate compliance risk levels
6. **Approval/Rejection**: Automated decision with human override capability

## Technical Implementation
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline
- Pharmaceutical knowledge graph integration
- Regulatory database APIs
- Machine learning models for compliance prediction
- Real-time validation feedback system
- Audit trail for all validation decisions

## Success Criteria
- 95% accuracy in therapeutic area extraction
- 99% compliance validation accuracy
- Sub-3 second validation response times
- Zero false positives for critical compliance violations
- Comprehensive audit trail for regulatory review
