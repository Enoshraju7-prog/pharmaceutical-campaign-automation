# Foundation Setup

## Description

Establish the core foundation for the pharmaceutical campaign automation system including database schema, API structure, UI framework, and environment configuration. This task creates the essential infrastructure components that all other system components will depend on.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database schema with Campaign and AgentExecution models defined
- [ ] FastAPI project structure with /api/v1/ routes implemented
- [ ] Basic Streamlit UI framework operational
- [ ] SQLite database auto-creation with Alembic migrations configured
- [ ] Environment configuration with all required variables documented
- [ ] All components can be started and communicate successfully

## Technical Details

### Database Models
- **Campaign Model**: Fields for campaign ID, name, therapeutic area, target HCP segments, compliance requirements, status, created/updated timestamps
- **AgentExecution Model**: Fields for execution ID, campaign ID, agent type, status, start/end times, results, error logs

### API Structure
- Base FastAPI application with CORS middleware
- `/api/v1/campaigns/` endpoint group
- `/api/v1/agents/` endpoint group
- Health check endpoint at `/api/v1/health`
- API documentation auto-generation with OpenAPI

### UI Framework
- Streamlit application with multi-page structure
- Campaign dashboard page
- Agent monitoring page
- Configuration management page
- Real-time status updates capability

### Database Configuration
- SQLite database with Alembic migration system
- Auto-creation of database on first run
- Migration scripts for schema evolution
- Connection pooling and error handling

### Environment Configuration
- `.env` file template with all required variables
- Database URL configuration
- API keys for external services
- Logging level configuration
- Development vs production settings

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundation task that other components depend on.

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (3-5 days)**
- Database schema design and implementation: 1 day
- FastAPI structure and routing: 1-2 days  
- Streamlit UI framework: 1 day
- Alembic migrations setup: 0.5 day
- Environment configuration: 0.5 day

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All database models can be created and migrated successfully
- [ ] FastAPI server starts without errors and serves API documentation
- [ ] Streamlit UI loads and displays basic navigation
- [ ] Environment variables are properly loaded and validated
- [ ] All components pass health checks
- [ ] Integration test demonstrates end-to-end connectivity
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
