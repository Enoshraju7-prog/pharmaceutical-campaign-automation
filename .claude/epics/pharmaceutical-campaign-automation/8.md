# Mock Data System

## Description

Create comprehensive mock data system for pharmaceutical campaign automation testing and demonstration. This includes realistic healthcare professional databases, therapeutic area data, historical campaign metrics, and compliance-ready content templates that simulate real-world pharmaceutical marketing scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Mock data for 6 therapeutic areas with realistic characteristics
- [ ] HCP database with 1000+ healthcare professionals per specialty/region combination
- [ ] Historical campaign performance metrics spanning 2+ years
- [ ] Compliance content templates with proper medical disclaimers
- [ ] Data generation scripts for easy refresh and scaling
- [ ] Realistic data relationships and constraints maintained

## Technical Details

### Therapeutic Areas
- **Diabetes**: Endocrinologists, PCPs, diabetes educators
- **Oncology**: Medical oncologists, hematologists, radiation oncologists
- **Cardiology**: Cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, electrophysiologists
- **Neurology**: Neurologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists
- **Dermatology**: Dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic specialists
- **Psychiatry**: Psychiatrists, psychologists, addiction specialists

### HCP Database Structure
- Professional demographics: name, specialty, sub-specialty, years of experience
- Practice information: hospital/clinic affiliation, location (state/region), practice size
- Prescribing patterns: volume, brand preferences, formulary constraints
- Digital engagement: email preferences, channel activity, response rates
- Compliance history: adverse event reporting, regulatory interactions

### Historical Campaign Metrics
- Campaign performance data: open rates, click-through rates, conversion metrics
- Seasonal patterns and trending analysis
- A/B testing results for different message variants
- ROI and cost-per-acquisition metrics
- Compliance incident tracking and resolution

### Compliance Content Templates
- FDA-compliant promotional messages for each therapeutic area
- Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) content
- Adverse event reporting templates
- Medical disclaimer variations
- Fair balance requirements for different content types

### Data Generation Scripts
- Faker-based realistic data generation
- Configurable volume and distribution parameters
- Relationship consistency validation
- Export capabilities for different formats (CSV, JSON, SQL)

## Dependencies

None - this task creates independent mock data that can be developed in parallel with foundation setup.

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (3-4 days)**
- Therapeutic area research and modeling: 1 day
- HCP database generation scripts: 1 day
- Historical metrics simulation: 1 day
- Compliance content templates: 1 day

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 6 therapeutic areas have complete mock data sets
- [ ] HCP database contains minimum 6000 records (1000+ per specialty/region)
- [ ] Historical metrics cover 24+ months with realistic patterns
- [ ] All compliance templates pass regulatory review checklist
- [ ] Data generation scripts can recreate entire dataset in under 5 minutes
- [ ] Data relationships maintain referential integrity
- [ ] Sample queries demonstrate realistic use cases
- [ ] Documentation includes data dictionary and generation instructions
