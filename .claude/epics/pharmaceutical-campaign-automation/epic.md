# Epic: Pharmaceutical Campaign Automation

## Overview

Build an AI-powered pharmaceutical campaign automation platform using Python FastAPI backend with Streamlit frontend, orchestrating 7 specialized agents via LangGraph workflow management. The system transforms manual 4-6 week campaign creation into automated few-days workflows while maintaining pharmaceutical compliance standards.

## Architecture Decisions

**Core Technology Stack:**
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI for high-performance async API
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for rapid development with built-in state management
- **Database**: SQLite for development with PostgreSQL production readiness
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph for workflow state management with Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for strict pharmaceutical data validation

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **Hub-and-spoke**: Master Orchestrator (Agent 7) coordinates 6 specialized agents
- **State Machine**: LangGraph manages workflow transitions and error recovery
- **Mock-first**: Complete mock API implementation for all external pharmaceutical systems
- **Async/await**: Non-blocking agent execution with timeout enforcement

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
**Streamlit Application Structure:**
- Single text input for natural language pharmaceutical campaign requests
- Real-time progress indicators using `st.progress()` and `st.status()`
- Agent execution dashboard with timing validation display
- Campaign results visualization with pharmaceutical metrics
- Mobile-responsive design with professional pharmaceutical styling

**State Management:**
- Streamlit session state for workflow progress tracking
- Polling backend API for real-time updates without WebSocket complexity
- Error boundary handling with graceful degradation and retry options

### Backend Services
**FastAPI Application Architecture:**
- `/api/v1/campaigns` - Campaign creation and status endpoints
- `/api/v1/agents` - Individual agent execution tracking
- `/health` - System health validation including agent readiness
- **Agent Orchestration**: Master Orchestrator using LangGraph workflow state machine

**Data Models:**
```python
Campaign {
  id: UUID
  user_input: str
  therapeutic_area: str
  target_specialty: str  
  geographic_region: str
  status: enum(processing/completed/failed)
  workflow_state: json
  created_at: datetime
}

AgentExecution {
  campaign_id: UUID
  agent_number: int(1-7)
  execution_time: float
  status: enum(pending/running/completed/failed)
  output_data: json
  langgraph_state: json
}
```

**Pharmaceutical Mock APIs:**
- Realistic therapeutic area data (diabetes, oncology, cardiology, neurology, dermatology, psychiatry)
- HCP database simulation (1000+ healthcare professionals per specialty/region)
- Historical campaign performance metrics for AI analysis
- Compliance content templates with medical disclaimers

### Infrastructure
**Development Environment:**
- Single command startup: `python main.py` launches both FastAPI (8000) and Streamlit (8501)
- SQLite auto-creation with schema migration via Alembic
- Mock mode enabled by default with `MOCK_MODE=true`

**Production Considerations:**
- Docker containerization for both services
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Environment-based configuration management

## Implementation Strategy

**Development Phases:**
1. **Foundation**: Database schema + FastAPI structure + basic Streamlit UI
2. **Agent Framework**: Master Orchestrator + LangGraph integration + timing validation
3. **Specialized Agents**: Implement 6 agents with pharmaceutical mock data
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation + error recovery
5. **Polish**: UI/UX refinement + performance optimization + compliance audit

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Mock-first approach eliminates external API dependencies
- LangGraph provides proven workflow state management
- Pharmaceutical compliance built into data models and validation
- Agent timeout enforcement prevents system resource exhaustion

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for all 7 agents with timing validation using `pytest`
- Integration tests for complete LangGraph workflow execution
- Frontend testing using Streamlit testing framework
- Performance tests validating sub-minute total execution time

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories for implementation:
- [ ] **Foundation Setup**: Database schema, FastAPI structure, Streamlit UI framework
- [ ] **Agent Framework**: Master Orchestrator with LangGraph, A2A communication protocol
- [ ] **Mock Data System**: Pharmaceutical data, HCP databases, historical campaigns
- [ ] **Specialized Agents**: 6 agents (Intelligence, Content, Organization, Veeva, Audience, Activation)
- [ ] **Frontend Integration**: Real-time progress, error handling, campaign results display
- [ ] **Validation System**: Input parsing, pharmaceutical keyword validation, compliance checks
- [ ] **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance validation
- [ ] **Documentation**: API docs, deployment guide, user manual

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Python 3.9+ environment with exact package versions specified in CLAUDE.md
- Git repository initialization for version control
- Basic pharmaceutical domain knowledge for realistic mock data

**Internal Dependencies:**
- LangGraph workflow implementation must complete before agent integration
- Mock pharmaceutical data must be realistic and comprehensive
- Database schema must support audit trail requirements for compliance
- Agent timing validation framework required before specialized agent development

**Critical Path:**
1. Database schema + FastAPI foundation
2. LangGraph Master Orchestrator implementation  
3. Mock pharmaceutical data system
4. Sequential agent development (blocking dependencies)
5. Frontend integration and testing

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Total workflow execution: â‰¤ few days (Master + 6 agents)
- API response times: <200ms for non-agent endpoints
- Frontend updates: Real-time without manual refresh

**Quality Gates:**
- 95% agent execution success rate within timing requirements
- 100% pharmaceutical input validation accuracy (accept/reject decisions)
- Complete audit trail for all agent executions and state transitions
- Zero hardcoded secrets or API keys in source code
- Mobile-responsive UI supporting tablets and smartphones

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Demo input: "Create diabetes campaign for Texas endocrinologists" completes successfully
- Error recovery: Agent failure doesn't require complete workflow restart
- Compliance: All generated content includes proper medical disclaimers
- Scalability: Support 5 concurrent campaign processing without degradation

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for MVP implementation
- Week 1: Foundation + Agent Framework + Mock Data System
- Week 2: Specialized Agents + Frontend Integration  
- Week 3: Testing + Polish + Documentation

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 Full-stack Python developer familiar with FastAPI and Streamlit
- Access to pharmaceutical industry knowledge for realistic mock data
- Basic understanding of compliance requirements for audit trail implementation

**Critical Path Items:**
- LangGraph workflow implementation (highest risk)
- Pharmaceutical mock data realism (affects demo quality)
- Agent timing optimization (performance requirement)
- Streamlit real-time updates (user experience critical)
